**Kateb** (كاتب) is an ancient Persian word that means "writer" or "scribe." The word evokes images of a time when writing was an art, practiced with ink and pen, capturing thoughts, events, and history. Much like the scribes of old, who meticulously documented information, a logger serves a similar purpose in the digital world, recording the flow of a program's execution, errors, and critical events.

**Kateb** is a logger package in the Go programming language that use `slog` standard library for logging. Just as a *kateb* would carefully document events for future reference, this logger ensures that your application's behavior is captured in a clear, concise, and reliable manner.

## Features

- **Flexible Logging Levels**: Control the verbosity of your logs with different levels (e.g., Debug, Info, Warn, Error).
- **Structured Logging**: Log your messages in a structured format, making them easier to parse and analyze.
- **Contextual Logging**: Add context to your logs to capture additional information about the environment or specific events.

## Installation

To install Kateb, use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/nilroad/kateb
```
